# HTTP Protocol Simulation Project - FOG Final Project -
 
## Overview
This project simulates the HTTP protocol in a simplified manner, providing a basic framework to understand HTTP communication. It mimics key features of HTTP, such as request/response handling, status codes, and basic error management, in order to demonstrate how clients and servers interact over the web.

## Features
- **Simulated HTTP Requests**: Mimics basic HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST).
- **HTTP Response Handling**: Simulates different HTTP status codes, such as 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
- **Error Handling**: Simulates errors like timeouts, server unavailability, and authentication failures.

## Project Description
This project is designed to simulate HTTP protocol interactions, focusing on request-response communication. It is an educational tool that provides insight into how web servers and clients communicate. The project is perfect for understanding basic HTTP mechanisms, such as connection timeouts, server availability, and common authentication issues.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/http-protocol-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Eclipse**:
   - Open Eclipse IDE.
   - Navigate to **File** > **Import** > **Existing Projects into Workspace**.
   - Select the cloned project folder.

3. **Ensure Java is Installed**:
   Make sure you have JDK installed and Eclipse is set up to run Java projects. You can download and install JDK from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

4. **Check Project Setup**:
   If any dependencies are required, ensure they are included in your Eclipse project settings. You may need to add libraries or packages for HTTP simulation.

## Usage

1. **Run the Project**:
   - In Eclipse, navigate to the `build/classes/controle/Principal.class` file.
   - Right-click on the file and select **Run As** > **Java Application**.

2. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - The program simulates HTTP requests, errors, and responses. You can modify the request types and view the corresponding simulated responses, such as server unavailability,       
     timeouts, and authentication errors.
